# -UART-implementation-with-CPLD-circuit

The purpose of the prototype was to design and implement simple asynchronous transmitter and receiver logics with TTL-RS232 serial communication.
The transmitter and receiver were designed as state machines that encoded in Verilog into two separate circuits. MACH4A5-64 / 32 CPLD circuits were used in the prototype.
